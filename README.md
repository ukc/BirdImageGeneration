This repository contains Deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) code for Bird images generation. 
The model is trained on [Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html) dataset. Bird images are generated from random noise using trained generative network.


Points:

1.  keep all image folders in the folder “./images”.
2.  For each epoch, generated images will be saved in “./generated_images” folder.
3.  Run : python bird_dcgan.py
